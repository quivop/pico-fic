Title: Alt Fic Masterlist
---

## Pinqury Fic Index

This is organized in alphabetical order. Assume that every fic here is for the Harry Potter fandom unless labelled otherwise. Series works are all lumped together under the same heading, and listed in recommended reading order. Ratings are according to [AO3's system][ao3-rating] because I'm lazy. 

In short, that's: 

- **G** for general audiences
- **T** for teen and up
- **M** for adult themes (porn, violence, etc) but no graphic descriptions, and
- **E** for explicit and graphicly described adult themes. 

I've included warnings for some, but not all of the fics, since it's been a while since I've read a bunch of them. Happy reading!

### Some shorthand I use in the masterlist

- "Diamond / Blockhead" means Diamond and Blockhead's romantic and/or sexual relationship is a focus in the fic
- "Diamond &amp; Blockhead" means Diamond and Blockhead's platonic relationship is a focus in the fic

### A Surreal Tale (series) {#ast} 
A Slytherin!Harry AU in which I indulged all my iddy yearnings for renamed!street-rat!Harry. The final story was sadly never completed, as I ran aground on that frequent bane of sorting!AU and canon divergence writers: keeping it all going past the first couple years. I had so much fun working on a lot of it, though, and I hope you have fun reading it too.

### The Tobias Snape Saga {#tobias}
So this was basically my first big fanfic. Severitus, way too many italics, Harry angsting over his Big Secret, it's all here! Last story succumbed to a mix of its being a large sprawling AU and my having gotten way too interested in churning out more of the Surreal Tale 'verse. Should still be a fun, iddy read.

1. Part the First
    - **Summary:** It's sixth year, and Harry has somehow gotten over Sirius' tragic death. The new problems that assail him now, however, are more mundane and mysterious. And the only person with any answers, is Professor Snape.
    - **Content Notes:** Rated T. Harry Potter &amp; Severus Snape. Around 60,000 words, complete.
    - **Links:** [FF.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2546037/1/Part-the-First) and [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/136522)
1. Part the Second
    - **Summary:** What has really become of Harry? Why does Severus have an irritating urge to visit Snape Manor after his son's macabre funeral? And what can Dumbledore be planning? Read to find out..
    - **Content Notes:** Rated M. Same characters as previous story. Around 60,000 words, complete.
    - **Links:** [FF.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2566793/1/Part-The-Second)
1. Part the Third
    - **Summary:** The arrival of Tobias Snape at Hogwarts causes a mindboggling amount of trouble, most of it for Tobias himself, who is not all that he seems. Third installment in the Tobias Snape Saga.
    - **Content Notes:** Rated M. Same characters as previous story. Around 50,000 words, abandoned.
    - **Links:** [FF.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2642988/1/Part-the-Third)

### Witch and Princess {#witchp}
- **Summary:** Lily helps Petunia play at being royalty in the garden, despite the fact that they look nothing like it. Severus does not approve.
- **Content Notes:** Rated everyone, it's basically all mundane friendship-- and popularity-related angst. Main character is biracial, AU Lily Evans, though there are generous helpings of Severus Snape and various Marauder-era players. Around 34,000 words, it is complete as of 1/10/11.
- **Links:** [FF.net](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6104107/1/Witch_and_Princess) and [AO3](http://archiveofourown.org/works/97408).

### With A Start {#withstart}
- **Summary:** The last thing Harry could remember was finishing his steak and kidney pie. He wakes up to find that his life has drastically changed to include wings, claws and the mostly animalistic mind of...a phoenix?
- **Content Notes:** Teens only, for swearing and some violence. This is basically gen wingfic, sorry to say-- written while I was still fascinated with poking at fannish tropes. Main characters are Harry Potter and Severus Snape. Around 21,000 words, this is a former WIP that is no longer being worked on.
- **Links:** [FF.net](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2806277/1/With_A_Start).
