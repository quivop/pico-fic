## Fic Masterlist

This is organized in alphabetical order. Assume that every fic here is for the Harry Potter fandom unless labelled otherwise. Series works are all lumped together under the same heading, and listed in recommended reading order.


### Ratings

Ratings are according to [AO3's system][ao3-rating] because I'm lazy. 

In short, that's: 

- **G** for general audiences
- **T** for teen and up
- **M** for adult themes (porn, violence, etc) but no graphic descriptions, and
- **E** for explicit and graphicly described adult themes. 

I've included warnings for some, but not all of the fics, since it's been a while since I've read a bunch of them. Happy reading!

### Some shorthand I use in the masterlist

- "Diamond / Blockhead" means Diamond and Blockhead's romantic and/or sexual relationship is a focus in the fic
- "Diamond &amp; Blockhead" means Diamond and Blockhead's platonic relationship is a focus in the fic
