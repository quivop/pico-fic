## Witch and Princess {#witchp}
- **Summary:** Lily helps Petunia play at being royalty in the garden, despite the fact that they look nothing like it. Severus does not approve.
- **Content Notes:** Rated everyone, it's basically all mundane friendship-- and popularity-related angst. Main character is biracial, AU Lily Evans, though there are generous helpings of Severus Snape and various Marauder-era players. Around 34,000 words, it is complete as of 1/10/11.
