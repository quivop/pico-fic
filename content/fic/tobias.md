## The Tobias Snape Saga {#tobias}
So this was basically my first big fanfic. Severitus, way too many italics, Harry angsting over his Big Secret, it's all here! Last story succumbed to a mix of its being a large sprawling AU and my having gotten way too interested in churning out more of the Surreal Tale 'verse. Should still be a fun, iddy read.
