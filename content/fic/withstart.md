## With A Start {#withstart}
- **Summary:** The last thing Harry could remember was finishing his steak and kidney pie. He wakes up to find that his life has drastically changed to include wings, claws and the mostly animalistic mind of...a phoenix?
- **Content Notes:** Teens only, for swearing and some violence. This is basically gen wingfic, sorry to say-- written while I was still fascinated with poking at fannish tropes. Main characters are Harry Potter and Severus Snape. Around 21,000 words, this is a former WIP that is no longer being worked on.
