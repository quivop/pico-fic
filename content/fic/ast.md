## The A Surreal Tale series
A Slytherin!Harry AU in which I indulged all my iddy yearnings for renamed!street-rat!Harry. The final story was sadly never completed, as I ran aground on that frequent bane of sorting!AU and canon divergence writers: keeping it all going past the first couple years. I had so much fun working on a lot of it, though, and I hope you have fun reading it too.
