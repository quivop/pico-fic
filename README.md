# Pico Fic

This lightly modified [Pico CMS][pico] install generates a barebones, pleasant-looking fic masterlist. Fics are stored in individual markdown files in the `content\fic` folder. You can rename that folder whatever you like, so long as you also change the references to the folder name on lines 14 and 29 in `themes\pinqo\masterlist.twig` accordingly.

Really, you can make any number of changes to this to suit yourself. Just have the Pico docs handy to help wade through any errors that pop up, and you should be all set.
